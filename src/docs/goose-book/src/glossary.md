## Taskset
A **taskset** in Goose is akin to what we would normally define as a **test
case** or a **scenario** in other test tools. It is a class of actions or steps
that the user would undertake to achieve a specific user journey.

## Task
A **task** is a single step within a **taskset**, like GET a homepage or POST a
form.
